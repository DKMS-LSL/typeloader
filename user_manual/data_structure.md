# ![Icon](images/TypeLoader_32.png)  TypeLoader's internal data structure 
TypeLoader's data is stored in the following structure:

  * Each sequence belongs to a project (usually a sample pool, or a different sensible set of samples).
  * Each project belongs to the TypeLoader account that created it. It and its alleles can only be accessed from this account.
  * Each login is a TypeLoader account and has a corresponding directory under <root\_dir> (the directory specified as TypeLoader's data path during setup).
  * Each project has a corresponding directory under <root\_dir>\\<login\>\projects\\<project\_name\>. Here, all files of the project are stored.
  * Each sample has a corresponding directory within its project's directory. Here, all files of the target alleles _within this project_ of this sample are stored.
  * A project can be either Open or Closed. _This has no influence on its folder path_, but only on the path displayed in the [=> Navigation Area](navigation.md).
  * All the data displayed on TypeLoader's GUI is stored in the account's own sqlite database, which is stored in a file called ``data.db`` within the account's directory (<login_dir>, see below).
  * ![important](images/icon_important.png) **All files should not be accessed directly but always using TypeLoader.**
