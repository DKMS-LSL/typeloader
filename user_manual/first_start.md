# ![Icon](images/TypeLoader_32.png) First TypeLoader Start
When you start TypeLoader for the first time after [=> Setup](setup.py), you will have to create a [=> User Account](users.md). **We strongly recommend creating a [=> Test Account](users_test.md) first!**

Once you have created an account and logged into it, TypeLoader will ask whether you want to update the reference data. Since the installation does not bring any reference data along, **you must accept the reference update** for TypeLoader to work!
Just click "Yes" and wait until another Popup appears to tell you that TypeLoader has (hopefully) successfully update its reference data (or give you an error message if a problem was encountered).

After the reference data has been downloaded and processed successfully, you can create your first ENA project ([=> New Project](new_project.md)) and add alleles to it ([=> New Alleles](new_allele.md)).
