# ![Icon](images/TypeLoader_32.png) Planned Future Developments

Here is an incomplete list of things we plan to implement in TypeLoader's future:

## Planned (will be implemented)
 * Internal code restructure for better performance and maintainability
 * Generate statistics over all data of one user and export them
 * Ability to automatically read IPD reply files
 * Internal allele names: recognize allele sequence if TypeLoader has already seen it before in another sample 

## Ideas (may be implemented, but not soon)
 * command line version (mainly for Linux)
 * option to start novel alleles at an earlier point, to use the "Lab process" part
 * more sophisticated rollback/change log mechanism
