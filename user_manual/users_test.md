# ![Icon](images/TypeLoader_32.png) Test Users

Before creating a productive TypeLoader user account, please create a test user: Any user name called "test" or starting with "test" (not case sensitive) is automatically considered a test user. 

(This means if your actual name happens to start with "Test", better choose a username that doesn't. ;-)) 

With a test account, you can test the following things without fear of causing problems:

 * Whether your connection to ENA works (usually a matter of proxy settings)
 * Whether your raw files work with TypeLoader
 * Which TypeLoader functions behave in what way
 * Generally, all aspects of TypeLoader

Test user accounts can do everything the other user accounts can do, but they are connected to the ENA *test* server, not the *productive* ENA server. So when you create projects or submit alleles to ENA, these are not submitted to the productive server (where getting wrong data deleted requires effort) but to the ENA test server where everything is deleted and cleaned up automatically after 24 hours.

Since [=> submission to IPD](submission_ipd.md) happens semi-automatically (TypeLoader creates all files, but you have to submit them by email or upload), test users are not necessary to test this process as the files can always be recreated and overwritten. But of course, you are welcome to play around with this on your test account, as well. 

See [=> Getting started](first_start.md) for an explanation how to get started, once you have created your test account.
