# ![Icon](images/TypeLoader_32.png) Detailled Views 

TypeLoader offers two types of Detailled Views for its elements:

  * **[=> Project View](view_project.md)**: shows all information about one project.
  * **[=> Sample View](view_sample.md)**: shows all information about all alleles of one sample.

These views are the main instruments to interact with a given allele, sample or table. They contain several tables which show the data of the selected object in a neat and intuitive arrangement. They also allow editing of these projects, samples and alleles. (Not all data can be edited, though, to ensure data consistency and protect from accidental changes.)

To open a Detailled View, rightclick the element of choice in the [=> Navigation Area](navigation.md) or an [=> Overview](overviews.md) and choose ``Open SampleView`` or ``Open ProjectView``.
