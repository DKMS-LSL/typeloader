# ![Icon](images/TypeLoader_32.png) Registering with IPD as a bulk submitter

Prior to submitting any sequences to IPD-IMGT/HLA or IPD-KIR using TypeLoader, please email [ipdsubs@anthonynolan.org](mailto:ipdsubs@anthonynolan.org) for approval to use TypeLoader for direct submission of data to IPD. The direct submission of data requires prior arrangement with the IPD Submissions team and unsolicited submissions will not be accepted. 

This process will allow the IPD Submissions team to assess the expected volume of submissions, and to confirm that the mandatory requirements for submissions will be met in any subsequent submissions. In addition, the IPD Submissions team will be able to provide a unique submitter ID for tracking submissions. 

To expedite this step, it is advisable that before reaching out to IPD, you submit a number of sequences to the appropriate IPD Database [=> using IPD's web-based submission tool](ipd_webform.md). This should included a number of confirmatory sequences to help confirm any methods used and expected accuracy of the sequences.

(You will only have to go through this process once per lab. If you have multiple TypeLoader users in your lab, they can share the same submitter ID and thereby count as one submitter for IPD.)
