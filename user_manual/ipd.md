# ![Icon](images/TypeLoader_32.png) Registering with IPD as a bulk submitter

Before you can submit TypeLoader-generated files directly to IPD, you must get in touch with them using [IPD's contact form](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/hla.php) and tell them you want to use TypeLoader to submit novel alleles. (At this point, you should already have submitted at least one allele manually using [IPD's Submission Page](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/subs/submit.html), and have received a submitter ID).

You should give them an idea about which loci you will be submitting and what numbers of alleles you expect to be submitting, and they will then guide you from there. 

Note that before approving you as a bulk submitter or otherwise allowing you to send submissions as files, they will ask for several validation sequences to make sure you will be submitting data of good quality.

(You will only have to do this once per lab. If you have multiple TypeLoader users in your lab, they can share the same submitter ID and thereby count as one submitter for IPD.)
