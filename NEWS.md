### Bugfixes:
- fix pretypings files for HLA-DMA, -DMB, -DOA, -DOB (#208)
- fix "all IPD-required loci present in pretypings" check

## 2.12.0 (2022-02-18)

  - increase timeout to 60 seconds to help users on a slow connection
  - handle timeout gracefully

### Backend:
- Updated ENA CLI to newest version 4.3.0 (#209)
- route all calls to external sites through proxy if specified (#206) 

## 2.11.1 (2021-11-25)
- Updated ENA CLI to newest version 4.2.3 (#201)

## Improvements:
- rename webin-cli.report after submissions to avoid overwriting (#199)
- Extended logging for webin-cli call (#198)

## Bugfixes:
- if playsound doesn't work, just skip it
- check for java installation before 1st webin-cli call

## 2.11.0 (2021-11-04)
### New Features:
- ENA files now include the TypeLoader & reference database version used to create them (#196)

### Improvements:
- RestartAllele Workflow adjusted to the fact that ENA does not allow sequence updates anymore (#85, #176)
- Throw meaningful errors if:
  - the input XML file cannot be handled (#191)
  - the reference db has probably gone stale (#193)

### Backend:
- Updated ENA CLI to newest version 4.2.1 (#192)
 - change: fusion introns can no longer be submitted to ENA as, e.g., 3/4 and are therefore submitted as 3 (but continue to be submitted as 3/4 to IPD) (#194)
 - submission software & version can now be transmitted to ENA via flatfile (#196)

## 2.10.0 (2021-02-16)
### New Features:
- Option to compare 2 TypeLoader generated files of the same type with each other via SampleView => View Files (#184)

### Improvements:
- Reference db updates between TypeLoader-Upload and IPD Submissions are now handled decently instead of throwing a vague BLAST error (#184)

## 2.9.0 (2020-12-10)
### New Features:
- New option to manually reset reference database to specific version (#171)
- New option to show all currently used versions (for reference databases and TypeLoader itself) (#174) 
- The used reference version is now included in IPD files (#172)
- New "Restart Allele" option. This provides a consistent way to handle necessary sequence corrections whenever the originally used sequence turns out to have been incorrect. By using this option, the ENA and IPD submission numbers are kept but otherwise the allele is started and all files generated from scratch with a fresh input sequence file. The allele gets the comment "restarted with fresh sequence". (#85)
- As a consequence, allele- and project files are no longer editable through TypeLoader. If you need to make edits, use the Restart Allele option.
- Comments are now displayed in the "General" tab of the SampleView insted of the "Lab Processing" tab. This should make it more prominent. 
- New projects: if the optional field "title" is left empty, the content of the field "pool" is copied there now. This enables easier identification of projects in the ENA webportal. (#177)

### Bugfixes:
- allele numbering after allele deletions has been fixed (#181)

### Backend:
- Updated ENA CLI to newest version 3.2.2

### New Features:
- Support for ENA Webin-CLI 3.1.0 (#154)
- Timeout after ENA server can't be reached for a certain time. Threshold can be set via Settings => Preferences (#161)
- Whitespaces in pretypings file are now removed (#165)

### Backend:
- Disabled "number of CDS bases must be divisable by 3" check for null alleles for HLA-E, to accomodate for a possible IMGT bug that previously made all HLA-E alleles null-alleles (#162)
- Converted to poetry project 

## 2.8.1 (2020-07-27)

## 2.7.1 (2020-03-09)
### Bugfix: 
- handle Webin-CLI replies with non-standard formatting (#147)

## 2.7.0 (2020-02-27)
### New Features:
- KIR2DL5A and 2DL5B are now treated as separate loci, in accordance with IPD's wishes.
- Ignore KIR pretypings for non-KIR IPD files, because IMGT/HLA cannot handle GL-strings. (#121)
- If a lock is encountered during IPD submission, it is now shown who created the lock. This enables the user to better decide whether this is a crash leftover and can safely be removed. (#136)
- If an allele is too different from all officially known alleles to handle correctly, this is now recognized and to the user. (#138) 
- The 'Options' menu now offers the downloading of logfiles. (#105)

### BugFixes:
- TypeLoader now handles changes within the first or last 3 bp of the allele correctly. (#124)
- Cleaner handling of XML input files: (#115)
  - Apply sanity check to both alleles, not just the first.
  - After user has chosen which allele to submit, delete the other one from this allele's files.
  - Thereby, both alleles of one locus of one sample starting with the same first field are now handled correctly.
- Alleles which start (slightly) before the 5' UTR of the reference allele are now handled correctly. (Previously the codons in the IPD difference strings were off.) (#143)
- Whitespaces in input-filenames can now be handled. (#134)
- Some adjustments for communication with the new ENA Webin CLI version. (#135)
- Safety: Closed projects can no longer be used to add or sumbit alleles. (#58)

- correctly catch and display errors from ENA submission, if they happen

## V2.4.1 (2019-08-07)

### Bugfixes
- various bugfixes to make the Windows installer work

## V2.3.1 (2019-05-03)
### new features
- Format of pretypings file changed (#95)

- many small ones

## 2.2.1 (2019-03-11)
### new features:
- Recognize multiple novel alleles in target locus: this is now checked during IPD file creation amd the files are formatted accordingly. If necessary, user input is requested to clarify which of the given alleles is the target allele. (#72)
- Pretyping checks: TypeLoader now checks whether the data given in the pretypings file fits the target alleles, and requests user changes where necessary to ensure consistent, sensible output. (#82)
- Faster startup: the AlleleOverview, which is used rarely but time-intensive to build, is now only generated on demand. (#80)
